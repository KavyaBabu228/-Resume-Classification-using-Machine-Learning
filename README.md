# -Resume-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning solution to automatically classify resumes into predefined job categories. The system is designed to streamline the recruitment process by reducing manual screening time, increasing accuracy in candidate matching, and improving the overall efficiency of hiring workflows.

üìå Objective
The objective is to build an end-to-end automated pipeline that:

Cleans and processes raw resume data.

Extracts meaningful features using natural language processing techniques.

Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to classify resumes accurately.

Optimizes model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

Deploys the best-performing model as an interactive web application for real-time classification.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the distribution, patterns, and structure of the resume dataset. This included:

Analysis of class imbalances and text length variations.

Frequency distributions of keywords, job titles, and skills.

Text normalization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to prepare the data for modeling.

Visualizations to uncover patterns and support feature engineering decisions.

üß† Model Development
Multiple classification algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. Key highlights include:

Feature extraction using Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

Comparison of model performance using cross-validation.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Selection of the best-performing model based on both performance and generalizability.

üîß Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was applied to refine model performance using methods such as:

GridSearchCV for exhaustive search.

RandomizedSearchCV for faster, probabilistic tuning.

Manual experimentation to fine-tune threshold settings and vectorization parameters.

This step significantly improved model accuracy and reduced overfitting.

üöÄ Deployment
To enable real-time, user-friendly interaction with the model, a web application was developed and deployed using [choose: Streamlit or Flask]. Key deployment features include:

A clean UI allowing users to upload resume files (text or PDF).

Backend processing to clean, vectorize, and classify the input using the trained model.

Instant feedback with the predicted job category.

Deployment readiness for both local hosting and cloud platforms like Heroku, Render, or Streamlit Cloud.

‚úÖ Project Outcomes
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data ingestion to deployment.

Achieved high classification accuracy with the selected model.

Successfully deployed a functional web application for practical use cases in HR tech or recruitment platforms.

üìà Future Enhancements
Implement deep learning-based NLP models such as BERT or RoBERTa for improved contextual understanding.

Extend to multi-label classification for resumes applicable to multiple job categories.

Add PDF parsing for diverse resume formats and structured outputs.
